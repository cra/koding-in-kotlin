# Super plan

## First session

[x] cloned the project
[x] made a circle that bounces

## Second session

[x] change something on border collision
[x] change velocity when pressing keyboard buttons
[x] store velocity as a individual property of the circle

## Brave New World

[ ] have a HUD with velocity
[ ] add multiple circles, maybe using dataclasses
[ ] have a map of velocities of circles of different colors
[ ] start colliding
