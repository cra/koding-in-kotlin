# Super plan

## First session

[x] cloned the project
[x] made a circle that bounces

## Second session

[x] change something on border collision
[x] change velocity when pressing keyboard buttons
[x] store velocity as a individual property of the circle

## Third session

[x] instantiate circles properly
[~] Ideal Gas route
    [x] add multiple circles
    [x] have a way to store velocities of circles of different colors


## Brave New World

[ ] have a text with velocity inside the scene
[ ] have a keypress that adds a circle to the box

[ ] Ideal Gas route
    [ ] start colliding
    [ ] check dataclasses
    [ ] make benchmarks, probably runtime-dependent
[ ] Continue with one ball
    [ ] add gravity or some sort of acceleration
    [ ] change something else like add air friction
[ ] Two-body problem? Three-body problems?
[ ] Make a platformer
