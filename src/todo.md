# Super plan

## First session: first steps

[x] cloned the project
[x] made a circle that bounces

## Second session: single jumpy ball

[x] change something on border collision
[x] change velocity when pressing keyboard buttons
[x] store velocity as a individual property of the circle

## Third session: multiple jumpy balls

[x] instantiate circles properly
[~] Ideal Gas route
    [x] add multiple circles
    [x] have a way to store velocities of circles of different colors

## Fourth session: adding and removing ~balls~ particles on demand

[x] bugfix directions
[x] have a keypress that adds a particle to the box
[x] have a keypress that deletes a particle from the box

## Fifth session: go further

[ ] introduce horizontal velocity and bounce of sides

[ ] maybe bounce particles from each other as well
[ ] have a text with velocity inside the scene (some sort of UI)
[ ] Ideal Gas route
    [ ] start colliding
    [ ] direction as vector

## Brave New World

[ ] velocity-based color?
    [ ] check dataclasses
    [ ] make benchmarks, probably runtime-dependent
[ ] Continue with one ball
    [ ] add gravity or some sort of acceleration
    [ ] change something else like add air friction
[ ] Two-body problem? Three-body problems?
[ ] Make a platformer
[ ] Add joystick
